# cryptic-auth-clients

This repository contains various clients for cryptic authentication, including implementations in TypeScript and React. Each client is designed to interact with a cryptic-auth host web server, providing reusable authentication logic, types, and utilities.

## Semantic Versioning

Every client will use the versioning of the cryptic-auth host web server, ensuring compatibility and consistency across different implementations. This means that each client will follow the same versioning scheme as the host server, allowing for easy upgrades and maintenance.

## Clients

- **Typescript**
  - **plain-ts**: A plain TypeScript client, suitable for server-side or any TypeScript environment.
  - **react-ts**: A React client based on the plain TypeScript client, leveraging React's hooks and context for state management. It is designed for use in React applications, providing a more integrated experience with React's component lifecycle and state management. (This client is currently in development and not yet available.)
  - **svelte-ts**: A Svelte client that uses the plain TypeScript client as a base, providing a Svelte-specific implementation for authentication. (This client is currently in development and not yet available.)
